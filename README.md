**Postman Beginner's Course - API Test Automation**

This repository contains my work for the Postman Beginner's Course on API Test Automation. Throughout the course, I learned how to create and automate API tests using Postman, including integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines. I have completed all the assignments and earned the official Postman badge.

**Course Overview**

The course covered:

- Writing API tests in Postman using JavaScript.
- Automating test execution with various Postman tools (Collection Runner, Postman CLI).
- Running tests using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.
  
**Key Concepts Learned**

- **Manual API Testing:** Learned how to manually test different API endpoints before automating them.
- **Writing API Tests in Postman:** Developed automated API tests using JavaScript scripts.
- **Using Postman Variables:** Utilized Postman variables to store and manage data, such as API keys and other secrets.
- **Assertions:** Wrote assertions to verify different aspects of API responses, including response status codes, response body content, and response headers.
- **JavaScript Basics:** Learned JavaScript concepts essential for writing effective tests, including variables, functions, and objects.
- **JSON Schema Validation:** Validated API response schemas using JSON schema validation.
- **Postman Collection Runner:** Used the collection runner to automate the running of collections.
- **Postman CLI:** Ran automated tests using the Postman CLI in CI/CD environments.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrated Postman tests into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
  
**Project Structure**
  
**Assignments:** Each assignment from the course is stored in a separate collection, forked and modified as per the requirements.

**Automated Tests:** The tests were written using Postman's built-in JavaScript editor, with a focus on functional testing.

**CI/CD Integration**

This repository also includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the running of Postman tests in a CI/CD pipeline.
